## Dev Checklist

### MVP

- [x] Render game board
- [x] Place a chip in a column and have it fill the last available space in that column
- [x] Alternate turns (Red, Yellow)
- [x] Calculate if there is a winner
- [ ] Clear or Reset Button

### Ideas for additional development

- Allow players to enter names, pick colors
- Allow different board dimensions
- Allow different numbers of players
- Different rules to win
- Animate the chips falling out when resetting
